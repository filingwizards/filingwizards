                                                    A limited liability company (LLC) is a form of business entity that
                                                    is separate and distinct from a person, like a corporation. The LLC
                                                    is often described as being a mix between a corporation and a
                                                    partnership (or sole proprietorship), offering some of the features
                                                    of each. For instance, similar to corporations, an LLC allows for
                                                    limited liability protection of its owner(s) (i.e. your risk is
                                                    limited to the amount that is invested in the LLC, and personal
                                                    assets beyond that are usually protected). And similar to a
                                                    partnership (or sole proprietorship), an LLC allows for pass through
                                                    taxation from the business to the owners. In short, an LLC is
                                                    advantageous if you are looking to receive some of the benefits that
                                                    corporations receive, but with fewer ongoing formalities and
                                                    obligations.

                                                    This is one of the most important benefits of an LLC. For federal
                                                    income tax purposes, the profits/losses of an LLC "pass through" to
                                                    the personal income of the owner(s). That is, LLC’s are not taxed at
                                                    the entity level. Instead, the owner(s) are individually taxed when
                                                    the LLC’s income or loss is “passed through” the business and
                                                    reported on the owner’s individual tax return. The specifics of how
                                                    the owner(s) file their taxes with the IRS depend on whether the LLC
                                                    has a single owner, or multiple owners.

                                                    The operating agreement is an internal contract amongst the owners
                                                    of the LLC, and lays out a number of specific details, such as the
                                                    owner’s respective ownership percentages and responsibilities,
                                                    accounting methods to be used in connection with profits/losses,
                                                    rules for adding or removing owners of the LLC, terms for ending the
                                                    LLC, etc. Most states do not require the LLC to prepare an Operating
                                                    Agreement (with the exception of New York, which does require it).
                                                    However, it is strongly advised, as the Operating Agreement can be
                                                    incredibly important in helping to resolve conflict amongst owners.

                                                    The "C" in C Corporation refers to a subchapter of the tax code.
                                                    Because C Corporations are quite common, they are often referred to
                                                    simply as “corporations.” One of the most important benefits to a C
                                                    Corporation is the limited liability protection that owners
                                                    (shareholders) receive. Under this protection, each shareholder’s
                                                    personal liability for the corporation’s business debts is limited
                                                    to the amount they invest (personal assets beyond this amount are
                                                    usually protected). However, there are certain downsides to forming
                                                    a C Corporation. Notably, C Corporations do not allow for the “pass
                                                    through” of the business’s taxes to the individual shareholders. As
                                                    a result, the C Corporation is taxed on the entity level, and then
                                                    the shareholders are taxed again in an individual capacity – a
                                                    feature that is often referred to as “double taxation.” C
                                                    Corporations are also distinguished from other entity types by the
                                                    formality with which certain obligations must be performed by the
                                                    members shareholders, such as in relation to shareholder meetings,
                                                    annual income reporting, and tax submissions.

                                                    An S Corporation is a type of corporation that has a special tax
                                                    status with the IRS. The formation requirements are similar to that
                                                    of C Corporations, but with the addition of a special form – IRS
                                                    Form 2553 – that must then be filed in order to have the government
                                                    recognize your business’s status as an S Corporation. This special
                                                    tax status eliminates the double-taxation that can occur with a C
                                                    corporation’s income. As a result, business profits or losses
                                                    "pass-through" to shareholders and are then reported on their
                                                    individual tax returns. Any tax due is paid by shareholders at their
                                                    individual tax rates, and no tax is paid at the corporate level.

                                                    Virtually all states require corporations to have a registered agent
                                                    in the state of incorporation. The registered agent receives
                                                    important legal and tax documents for the corporation (including
                                                    important mail sent by the state, such as annual reports or
                                                    statements, tax documents, and service of process relating to
                                                    lawsuits), must have a physical address (no P.O. Boxes) in the state
                                                    of incorporation, and be available during normal business hours.
                                                    Post office boxes and private rented mailboxes are NOT permissible
                                                    for this purpose. Registered agents are not only required by most
                                                    entity types, but they are also very helpful in ensuring that
                                                    important documents are professionally and discreetly handled. It is
                                                    for this reason that almost all businesses use a registered agent
                                                    service. Please contact us for assistance in obtaining a Registered
                                                    Agent.

                                                    Share par value. The par value of a share is its minimum stated
                                                    value and common par values are $0.01, $1.00 or no par. The actual
                                                    value of a share is its fair market value, or what someone is
                                                    willing to pay for it. For public companies, actual value is
                                                    determined by the price that investors are willing to pay for each
                                                    share on a national exchange. For private companies, the actual

                                                    rules of your corporation, and provide comprehensive guidelines for
                                                    keeping things running smoothly. One important role of the by-laws
                                                    is to specify the duties and responsibilities of a corporation’s
                                                    board of directors, executive committee members, and other important
                                                    individuals. The by-laws also determine how those in charge are
                                                    nominated or elected, and they help settle any disputes among
                                                    parties. Since it is such an important document, corporate by-laws
                                                    they must be formally adopted, and formally amended when there are
                                                    any changes. It is very important that bylaws be customized to your

                                                    The process is relatively straightforward and inexpensive. To start
                                                    a sole proprietorship, you do not need to file any papers. Instead,
                                                    you simply go into business. In other words, if you'll be the only
                                                    owner of the business you're starting, your business will
                                                    automatically be a sole proprietorship, unless you incorporate it or
                                                    organize it as an LLC. However, it is extremely important that you
                                                    do not neglect any business licenses, permits, and taxes, as these

                                                    of the Articles of Incorporation, but much of the requested
                                                    information is consistent across the states. To prepare the Articles
                                                    of Incorporation, you will need to provide the name of your
                                                    business, the purpose of your business, a registered agent, and
                                                    choose an incorporator, director and officers. In other words, the
                                                    process is extremely similar to the process for the other types of
                                                    Corporations discussed above. Please contact us for assistance in

                                                    There are a number of reasons why an LLC might be right for you. For
                                                    instance, LLCs typically offer a good amount of flexibility in terms
                                                    of how the business is structured and managed. In this regard, LLCs
                                                    do not face strict ongoing requirements regarding meetings (i.e.,

                                                    or shareholders, or that meeting minutes be recorded). There are

                                                    number and types of owners. It is for this reason that majority of
                                                    the big companies you’ve heard of are C Corporations. C Corporations
                                                    also offer flexibility in terms of classes of stock, making them

                                                    S Corporations have certain features that may make them unfavorable
                                                    in certain situations. For example, S Corporations can only have one
                                                    class of stock. As a result of this limitation, there cannot be
                                                    different classes of investors entitled to different types of rights
                                                    or different dividend amounts, which is something that may be
                                                    important if you are trying to get investors for your business
                                                    (people who invest first, or invest a lot of money, often would like
                                                    to receive higher dividend rates, or greater rights, in exchange for
                                                    investing first). Additionally, S Corporations cannot have more than
                                                    100 shareholders. Also ownership (i.e., foreign ownership) is
                                                    prohibited. So while avoiding double taxation is great, an S
                                                    Corporation might not be right for you.

                                                    <p>
                                                        S Corporations have more formalities in terms of their
                                                        day-to-day operating requirements. For example, S Corporations
                                                        must adopt bylaws, issue stock, hold initial and annual director
                                                        and shareholder meetings, and keep meeting minutes with
                                                        corporate records. Alternatively, LLCs have “recommended”
                                                        formalities for their day-to-day operating requirements, such as
                                                        adopting an operating agreement, issuing membership shares,
                                                        holding and documenting annual member meetings and documenting
                                                        all major company decisions. In short, LLC’s don’t need to do
                                                        anywhere near as much as S Corporations.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Additionally, LLC’s have a choice as far as how the business is
                                                        managed. If managed by members (i.e., owners), then the LLC
                                                        operates much like a partnership. If run by managers, then the
                                                        LLC more closely resembles a corporation, and members will not
                                                        be involved in the daily business decisions. On the other hand,
                                                        S Corporations have directors and officers. The directors
                                                        oversee corporate affairs and handle major decisions, but do not
                                                        get involved in daily operations. Instead, directors elect
                                                        officers who manage daily business affairs.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Another difference relates to the existence of the business. S
                                                        corporations can exist forever. However, for LLC’s, some states
                                                        require the LLC to list a dissolution date (i.e., end date) of
                                                        the business in the formation documents. Also, for LLC’s, some
                                                        events, such as the death or withdrawal of a member, can cause
                                                        the LLC to dissolve.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Also, in terms of ownership transfers, the stock of an S
                                                        Corporation is freely transferable, as long as certain IRS
                                                        ownership restrictions are met. So there is a great amount of
                                                        flexibility in terms of who can be an owner of an S Corporation.
                                                        However, LLC members cannot freely transfer their ownership
                                                        stake in the business without obtaining approval first in most
                                                        cases. Thus, LLC’s are much more restrictive in terms of
                                                        ownership changes.

                                                        These are but a few of the many differences between an S
                                                        Corporation and an LLC. If you need further clarification on
                                                        what type of business might be right for you, we are happy to
                                                        help any way we can; however, we strongly encourage you to reach
                                                        out to an accountant or legal professional. If this applies to

                                                    Many people choose to incorporate their business in the state in
                                                    which their company is physically located. This is called “home

                                                    S Corp, Not for Profit Corp., etc.), you must pay filing fees to the

                                                    Additionally, you will be subject to ongoing requirements and fees

                                                    In order to determine which state will be the best state for your
                                                    business, you should research that state’s laws and tax requirements
                                                    related to Corporations, LLCs, and other types of businesses. For
                                                    example, if foreign qualification will be necessary, you may want to
                                                    consider whether a state imposes an income tax on corporations and
                                                    LLCs, as well as whether there is a minimum tax or a franchise tax.
                                                    This is important to consider because the added costs of fulfilling
                                                    the ongoing filing and taxation requirements imposed by the state of
                                                    incorporation and state(s) of foreign qualification often outweigh
                                                    the perceived benefits of incorporating outside the home state. You
                                                    may also want to consider calculating your company's projected
                                                    revenue for its first few years of existence and then evaluate
                                                    states in terms of the true amount of taxes required, to see if
                                                    there may be an advantage. These are often complicated
                                                    considerations that require the assistance of a tax professional or
